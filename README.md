# Metapop_Model
C++ code for the metapopulation model of mosquitp population dynamics described in the paper "Fine-scale modelling finds that breeding site fragmentation can reduce mosquito population persistence" (Communications Biology, 2019). 

The code was developed using Visual Studio 2017 (Version 15.0), and all output from the model is saved in .csv files. 

Parameter values can be inputted manually, or by reading in values from a .txt file (such as Example_Params.txt). The file "Run_Model.bat" runs the metapopulation model for the parmeters specified in Example_Params.txt.
